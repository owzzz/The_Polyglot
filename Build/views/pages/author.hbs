	<p>My first word as a child was água. It’s been my favorite drink ever since.</p>

	<p>But at 23, I was thirsty for something else. So I left Brazil and got a job as a copywriter in NYC. Different country, different pizza, and a lot of new words.</p>

	<p>And as my vocabulary grew, I felt inspired to create this project. So I could help you expand yours.</p>

	<p>What will be your first word?</p>
